# DevOps with Docker

These are my solutions for the course DevOps with Docker, available at <https://devopswithdocker.com/>.

Sidenote: running these exercises on an ARM-based Mac with an M1 chip resulted in a bunch of warnings, as some of the images did not have native ARM builds available:

> WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested

However, this did not have any significant impact on solving these exercises.
